(*These are test cases *) 

(*Test Case #1 for Strings*)

"here is a string that ends right after a new line
"
"I am a strin!@#$%^&*~`(){}|\:;'<>,.?/g with a new line | right here,
so hopefully your line count incremented"
Now lets start a string "in the middle of the line" and 
make sure it still works.

"We know that newlines work, but what about tabs: 	?"
